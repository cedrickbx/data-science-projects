of the house) is associated with a higher sale price, indicative of a positive association between the 2 variables.\n","* A gentler general positive trend can be observed between overall condition and sale price, though it seems that the higher sale prices (with more data points) tend to be when the condition of the house is average(at 5). One reason could be due to more buyers wanting to purchase the house for an overhaul and do not need a house in pristine condition house for that and since there is more demand in house at that condition, the prices tend to be higher due to the limited supply compared to higher market
